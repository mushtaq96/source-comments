I am put into a new team with none of them well versed in English. 
With no English documentation whatsoever; the project's source code should give me an idea I thought, yet it doesn't. 
Why ? the comments they are in Japanese - I decide to write a simple program to help me understand source code by translating the comments to English.


### How to emulate ?

1. Create a python virtual environment using venv
# python3 -m venv yourVirtualEnvName

2. Install the pakage dependencies 
# pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask program
# python app.py
